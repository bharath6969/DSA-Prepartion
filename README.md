Explain your approach in **three sentences only** at top of your code

# Design-1

## Problem 1:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)



## Problem 2:
Design MinStack (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)


#### Approach 

I used two lists(Arrays)

list1 as the parent stack
list2 as the child stack for min stack value 

Approach was to do one to  one mapping 


push :
append the elements to main stack 
append the min_value to child stack 

pop: 
delete the last elements in both stack

getmin:
retrive the last element from the childstack

peek 
return the last element from mainstack
